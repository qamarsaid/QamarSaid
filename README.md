## Hi there 👋🏾👋🏾 I am Qamar Said

I am a German national who arrived in this country in 2010. I learned English by spending six years volunteering at my local library, where I immersed myself in English literature across various genres, fostering a love for reading and understanding of the English language. This passion for learning persisted throughout my biochemistry & biotechnology degree, where I further developed my statistical analysis abilities through interpreting lab reports and visualising data. My intrigue with data analysis, within the biotechnology degree, led me to pursue additional training in various coding languages through a Digital Skills Data Technician Bootcamp programme with Just IT Training.
